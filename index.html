      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <em>Silueta</em> series (1973–1980) comprises performances in which Ana
        Mendieta imprinted or outlined her silhouette into natural elements such as sand,
        earth, rock or fire. Working from the perspective of a Cuban exile informed by
        Afro‑Cuban and indigenous traditions, she sought to reconnect with land and
        ancestral cosmologies. Her earth‑body works challenge imperial scopic regimes—
        systems of seeing and representation that link observation to knowledge and
        power. By dissolving her body into landscape, Mendieta resists the
        colonising gaze that historically positioned the European subject as classifier
        and possessor of other beings. Each work foregrounds transformation, ritual
        and entanglement rather than fixed representation. Click an image in the gallery

    <!-- Limitations section -->
    <section id="limitations" class="section">
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Silueta actions survive primarily through photographs and films;
          documenting them freezes events meant to vanish, reintroducing the camera’s
          frame and potentially reinscribing the imperial scopic regime.</li>
        <li>Associations between women and nature risk reinforcing essentialist or
          voyeuristic tropes; the female body may still be objectified despite
          the artist’s intention to dissolve it.</li>
        <li>Using sacred or protected sites and indigenous rituals blurs homage and
          appropriation; context can be lost when works are detached from the
          communities that inform them.</li>
        <li>Exhibiting the works within Western institutions situates them inside
          structures of power they aim to critique, influencing how audiences read
          them.</li>
        <li>Materials such as blood, fire and vivid pigments may draw attention to
          spectacle rather than to the decolonial critique embedded in the actions.</li>
      </ul>
